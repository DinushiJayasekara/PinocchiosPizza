# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This website is to display the menu of Pinocchio's Pizza & Subs and also allow its customers to create accounts and order items from the shop.

The static folder contains the CSS files for styling while the templates folder consists of all HTML files.

All requirements given in the course specification have been covered.

2 personal touches have been added:

1.) A confirmation email is sent to the customer after he/she submits an order

2.) Customers have the option of clearing their cart after adding items
